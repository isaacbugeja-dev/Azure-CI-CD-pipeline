AZ-204 Example case:
Create a simple web app (e.g., with Azure App Service or Azure Functions) and set up a CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps to deploy it automatically.

# Activate venv
venv\Scripts\activate


# Requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Issues
Cannot run build on Azure Devops since there is issue with parallelism - need to purchase/be granted free version by request.
